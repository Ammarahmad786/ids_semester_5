3. HEALTH IMPACTS OF POLLUTANTS
- PM2.5 & PM10: Can penetrate deep into lungs; linked to heart disease and asthma.
- NO2 & SO2: Respiratory irritants; can cause inflammation of the airways.
- CO: Reduces oxygen delivery to the body's organs and tissues.
- O3 (Ozone): Can trigger chest pain, coughing, and throat irritation.

4. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES
- Promote Electric Vehicles (EVs) and transition away from fossil fuel transport.
- Implement stricter industrial emission standards and green buffer zones.
- Expand urban forestry and vertical gardens to naturally filter pollutants.
- Real-time monitoring and public alerts during high pollution cycles.
- Policy: Carbon taxing for industries exceeding emission caps.

5. IDENTIFIED CYCLES & PATTERNS
- Seasonal Variance: Higher PM2.5 levels detected during winter months due to inversions.
- Industrial Influence: Positive correlation between CO/NO2 and high-density industrial zones.
- Meteorological Impact: Humidity shows a slight positive relationship with particulate matter retention.
- Diurnal Cycle: Peak pollution often recorded during rush hours (morning/evening).

6. CONCLUSION
The analysis indicates that while some cities maintain 'Good' AQI levels, industrial hubs require immediate intervention. Predictive modeling shows high accuracy with Linear models, suggesting strong linear relationships among pollutants.
